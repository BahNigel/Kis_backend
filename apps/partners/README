8. Wire it into settings & URLs
settings.py
Add the app:
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "apps.chat",
    "apps.groups",
    "apps.partners",
]
config/urls.py
Include the partners API (similar to chat/groups):
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path("api/v1/chat/", include("apps.chat.urls", namespace="chat")),
    path("api/v1/groups/", include("apps.groups.urls", namespace="groups")),
    path("api/v1/partners/", include("apps.partners.urls", namespace="partners")),
]
So your full endpoints look like:
POST /api/v1/partners/partners/ → create a partner (+ optional main conversation)
GET /api/v1/partners/partners/ → list partners the user owns or is in the main conversation
GET /api/v1/partners/partners/{id}/ → partner details
POST /api/v1/partners/partners/{id}/deactivate/ → deactivate partner
9. How this ties into chat & the “big app”
Each Partner is an organization that can own:
multiple Communities,
Groups,
Channels,
and a top-level main Conversation.
When you create a partner (and create_main_conversation=true):
A Conversation(type=GROUP) is created and linked as partner.main_conversation.
The owner becomes ConversationMember with base_role=owner.
ConversationSettings row is created for that conversation.
Later:
Communities, Groups, Channels will all carry a partner = ForeignKey(Partner, ...).
Frontend can:
Call Partners API to show the list of organizations the user belongs to.
Use main_conversation_id to open the “Partner main chat” in your RN chat UI via NestJS.
