8. Wire it into Django
settings.py
Add to INSTALLED_APPS:
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "apps.chat",
    "apps.partners",
    "apps.groups",
    "apps.communities",
]
config/urls.py
Include the communities API:
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path("api/v1/chat/", include("apps.chat.urls", namespace="chat")),
    path("api/v1/partners/", include("apps.partners.urls", namespace="partners")),
    path("api/v1/groups/", include("apps.groups.urls", namespace="groups")),
    path("api/v1/communities/", include("apps.communities.urls", namespace="communities")),
]
9. How this fits into the bigger picture
Partner
Owns many Communities.
Has optional main_conversation (partner-wide room).
Community
Belongs to a Partner.
Has optional main_conversation (community lobby).
Will own many Groups and Channels.
Group
Belongs to a Community (and optionally to a Partner directly).
Has its own conversation.
Everything is anchored on Conversation from chat, which is what your NestJS backend will use for messages.
When you create a community via:
POST /api/v1/communities/communities/
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "partner": "<partner_id>",
  "name": "KIS Dev Community",
  "slug": "kis-dev",
  "description": "Community for Kingdom Impact devs",
  "avatar_url": "https://...",
  "create_main_conversation": true
}
you get back:
Community id
partner
main_conversation_id → that’s the conversation you open in your React Native chat UI and connect to NestJS with.
